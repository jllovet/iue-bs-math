\subsection{Synthetic Division}
    Synthetic division is used to determine whether a zero of a function
    is a factor of a polynomial.
    Core algorithm:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Start with the leading coefficient.
        \item Multiply the zero by that coefficient to produce an intermediate term. 
        \item Add that intermediate term to the next coefficient to produce a remainder.
        \item Multiply the zero by that remainder to produce the next intermediate term.
        \item Repeat until the final coefficient is reached.
        \item If the final remainder $= 0$, then the zero is a factor of the polynomial.
        \item If the final remainder $\neq 0$, then the zero is not a factor of the polynomial.
    \end{itemize}
