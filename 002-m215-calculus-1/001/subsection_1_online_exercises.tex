\begin{exercise}
    \textbf{Given:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A cylindrical water tower with a radius of $15m$ and a height of $60m$ is filled to a height of $h$.
        \item The volume $V$ of water​ (in cubic​ meters) is given by the function​ $g(h) = 225\pi h$.
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Find:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The appropriate domain of the function, the independent and dependent variables
    \end{itemize}
\end{exercise}
\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}

\begin{solution}
    While the function $g(h) = 225\pi h$ would accept any value from $\{ h \mid h \in \mathbb{R}\}$ in general,
    in the context of this question, we are only concerned with the values of $h$ that correspond to possible
    heights of water that can be put into the tower.
    
    Because there cannot be a negative amount of water in the tower, we know that $h \geq 0$.
    Similarly, because the water tower itself is $60m$ tall, the amount of water that can be put in the tower
    is limited to $60m$, meaning that $h \leq 60$.
    Taking these restrictions together: $$0m \leq h \leq 60m$$

    Finally, since $h$ can vary freely within the domain and is not determined by another quantity in the function $g(h)$,

    and since $V$ is determined by the function $g(h)$,
    
    therefore, for the equation $g(h) = 225\pi h$:

    \fbox{\parbox{\textwidth}{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The domain is $[0, 60]$
            \item The independent variable is $h$
            \item The dependent variable is $V$
        \end{itemize}
        }
    }
