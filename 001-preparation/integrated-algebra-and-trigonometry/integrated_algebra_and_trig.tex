\title{Notes on Fisher and Ziebur's\\\textit{Integrated Algebra and Trigonometry}}

\maketitle

I am going to be reading \textit{Calculus, Early Transcendentals} by \textcite{briggsCalculusEarlyTranscendentals2019} in school.

To prepare to read \textcite{briggsCalculusEarlyTranscendentals2019},
here I am reviewing algebra and trigonometry,
to help me identify gaps in my knowledge and
to help me practice presenting my work in \LaTeX.

\section{The System of Real Numbers}

To get things going with their presentation of algebra,
\textcite{fisherIntegratedAlgebraTrigonometry1962}
introduce the system of real numbers.
In their discussion, they explicitly presume a working familiarity
with the rules of arithmetic and basic number systems.
The first set of numbers they discuss are the positive integers.

\subsection{Laws Applicable to Positive Integers}

\begin{align}
    &(a+b)+c = a+(b+c) &&\text{Associative Law of Addition}\\
    &(ab)c = a(bc) &&\text{Associative Law of Multiplication}\\
    &a+b = b+a &&\text{Commutative Law of Addition}\\
    &ab = ba &&\text{Commutative Law of Multiplication}\\
    &a(b+c) = ab+ac &&\text{Distributive Law}\\
    &(b+c)a = ba+ca &&\text{Distributive Law by Comm. Law of Mult.}
\end{align}

In addition to these, Fisher and Ziebur point out the following interesting pair of properties.
For any two positive integers \(a, b \)
\begin{align}
    &\text{there is another integer \(c\) such that} &&a+b = c\\
    &\text{there is not always an integer \(d\) such that} &&a-b = d
\end{align}

Rephrasing these in terms of sets:
\begin{align}
    &\forall \, a, b \, \{a, b \in \mathbb{Z} \,|\, a+b \in \mathbb{Z}\}\\
    &\exists \, a, b \, \{a, b \in \mathbb{Z} \,|\, a-b \not\in \mathbb{Z}\}
\end{align}

Start interpolation.

As an aside, \textcite{fisherIntegratedAlgebraTrigonometry1962} claim the following:
\begin{quote}
    It can be shown that the rules of arithmetic
    for integeres are the only ones that preserve
    the associative, commutative, and distributive
    laws.
\end{quote}

I'm not convinced of this just yet, but I suspect that some inquiries into abstract algebra will help me see whether this is the case.

End interpolation.
