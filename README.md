# Indiana University East Bachelors of Science in Mathematics
---

Here you will find Jonathan Llovet's notebooks, papers, code, helpful references, and other work towards the IUE B.S. in Mathematics.

**Note:** Some of the projects in this repo will require some software dependencies. Where possible, I will provide a dockerized environment for each of them, to abstract away the setup. Docker is a tool used frequently in software engineering for creating containers, which are similar to lightweight virtual machines, but make more efficient use of the resources of the underlying host machine.
