# Indiana University East Bachelors of Science in Mathematics
---

Here you will find my notebooks, papers, code and other work towards the IUE B.S. in Mathematics. Sprinkled among these attempts at clear thinking are resources and reflections you may find helpful about mathematics, software, and philosophy.

   >**Note:** Some of the projects in this repo will require some software dependencies. See [here](#Environment-Setup).

# Tools and Resources
---

Articles and resources about sundry topics you may need for interacting with my repository, but that you may not be familiar with yet, depending on your background.

## Environment Setup
Where possible, I will provide a containerized environment for any work that uses software, to abstract away the setup. To do this, I will primarily use Docker. Docker is a tool used frequently in software engineering for creating containers, which are similar to lightweight virtual machines, but make more efficient use of the resources of the underlying host machine.

## MarkDown

This document is in Markdown!

   > Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

### LaTeX

   > LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents. LaTeX is available as free software.
