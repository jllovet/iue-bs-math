# Indiana University East - Bachelors of Science in Mathematics üßÆ
---

Here you will find my notebooks, papers, code and other work towards the IUE B.S. in Mathematics. Sprinkled among these attempts at clear thinking are resources and reflections you may find helpful about mathematics, software, and philosophy.

   >**Note:** Some of the projects in this repo will require some software dependencies. See [here](#Environment-Setup).

If you'd like to help support my studies and projects like this repo, I'd be delighted if you bought me a coffee.

# Tools and Resources
---

Articles and resources about sundry topics you may need for interacting with my repository, but that you may not be familiar with yet, depending on your background.

## Environment Setup
Where possible, I will provide a containerized environment for any work that uses software, to abstract away the setup. To do this, I will primarily use Docker. Docker is a tool used frequently in software engineering for creating containers, which are similar to lightweight virtual machines, but make more efficient use of the resources of the underlying host machine.

## MarkDown

This document is in Markdown!

   > Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

## LaTeX

   > LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents. LaTeX is available as free software.

#### Zotero
   > Zotero is a free, easy-to-use tool to help you collect, organize, cite, and share research.
   Source: [https://www.zotero.org/](https://www.zotero.org/)

- I use Zotero to generate .bib files for myself to use in my LaTeX documents. See below on Biblatex.
#### biblatex and biber
   > The biblatex package is becoming the definitive citation management tool for LaTeX users. Biblatex provides a powerful and flexible macro interface for authors of citation styles.
   Biblatex's own data backend processor, biber, allows biblatex to offer [a lot of] features.

## Knowledge Management System ·ç® üë®üèª‚Äçüíª üìÑ
I'm trying out [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to manage a knowledge graph for myself with Markdown and will be storing in this repository. Running notes will be in Markdown with mathematical sketches in inline LaTeX and embedded diagrams generated from other tools. Since Markdown is plain-text, this knowledge graph will be maintainable through git, like the rest of the project. It will be consumable through Obsidian or [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) (one of its VSCode-plugin competitors).

## Visualizations and Math Tools

### Jupyter

Jupyter provides interactive coding notebooks that make it easy to prototype, create visualizations and interactive presentations, and to make the software used in research more transparent. Jupyter notebooks are used widely both in industry and in academia.
I will use Python-based Jupyter notebooks primarily, but other programming languages are supported. You can find out more about the project here.

- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)

I have defined a docker image that builds on the [Docker Stacks](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html) that are maintained by the Jupyter Team. That image can be found in Docker Hub under [jllovet/math-notebook](https://hub.docker.com/r/jllovet/math-notebook), and the definition can be found in this repository under [000-setup/jupyter](https://github.com/jllovet/iue-bs-math/tree/main/000-setup/jupyter), where you can also find usage instructions.
